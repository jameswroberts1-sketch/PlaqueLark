While living in London she moved in literary and theatrical circles, adapting her own works for the stage. Her books have repeatedly been filmed and re-illustrated, with The Secret Garden in particular continuing to shape how readers imagine recovery, friendship and the magic of neglected places.",

Succeeding William Wilberforce in the campaign, he pressed for the abolition of slavery throughout the British Empire, which was finally enacted in the 1830s. He also advocated prison reform and better treatment of Indigenous peoples. Working and living at the Truman Brewery in Brick Lane, he combined business interests with humanitarian activism, showing how a successful industrialist could use wealth and influence to push for far-reaching moral change.",

He was a leading figure in �Tory Democracy�, advocating imperialism combined with limited social reform, and he played a central role in party battles of the 1880s. Living at Connaught Place, he enjoyed the social whirl of the West End while pursuing a combative, often self-destructive political career. His abrupt resignation over military budget cuts effectively ended his rise, but his style and reputation deeply influenced his son�s view of politics and ambition.",

Rediscovered in the 20th century, Kalvos is now seen as a key precursor to modern Greek poetry.",

The experience broadened his outlook and gave him a lasting respect for aspects of British political culture. Returning to India and then South Africa, he forged his philosophy of non-violent resistance, later leading mass campaigns�such as the Salt March�against British rule. The London address recalls an early, formative chapter before he became �Mahatma�, the spiritual leader of Indian independence.",

He produced book illustrations, ceramics for Wedgwood and murals, but is best known for watercolours of chalk downs, trains, lighthouses and quiet interiors, often with a subtle sense of unease. During the Second World War he worked as an official war artist, recording airfields and naval scenes. In 1942 he was lost when an RAF aircraft failed to return from an air-sea rescue mission near Iceland. His Upper Mall address looks onto the Thames he often drew, a river of changing light and industrial shapes.",

Combining detailed drawing with a slightly eerie imagination, he appealed to adults as much as to children. From his home in Chalcot Gardens he walked nearby parks and back streets, sketching trees and figures that later reappeared in transformed guise. His style became one of the defining visual languages of early 20th-century fantasy illustration.",

He promoted systematic physical training, opened gyms, wrote instructional books and even marketed his own health products. Sandow organised one of the first major physique competitions at the Royal Albert Hall in 1901. His London home anchored a career that moved between showmanship, business and a new, quasi-scientific approach to physical culture.",

A co-founder of the Fabian Society, he combined socialism with a wicked wit in plays such as Major Barbara, Saint Joan and Pygmalion. Shaw used theatre to debate class, religion, war and women�s rights, while his prefaces and essays were almost as famous as the plays themselves. From his London homes he wrote at a formidable pace and attended endless meetings, arguments and rehearsals. Awarded the Nobel Prize and an Oscar, he remains a model of the engaged, argumentative dramatist.",

Fiercely anti-fascist, he created searing visual attacks on Hitler, Goebbels and big business for left-wing magazines, cutting and recombining press photos into shocking, often darkly comic images. After the Nazis came to power he fled, eventually settling in London for part of his exile. There he continued to produce anti-Nazi artwork and worked in theatre and film design. His London address marks a temporary refuge for an artist whose collages turned the tools of mass media against totalitarian propaganda.",

Tussaud combined craftsmanship with shrewd showmanship, understanding the public appetite for proximity to the famous and infamous.

Originating in music hall, the act moved into films and radio, becoming hugely popular from the 1930s into the 1950s. With his then wife Kitty McShane as the �daughter�, Lucan created chaotic domestic scenes full of slapstick and catchphrases. Off-stage his personal life was much less cosy, marked by marital breakdown and financial strains. The plaque recalls a modest London base behind a character who once packed cinemas and variety theatres.",

Visiting London in 1863, he stayed at Brompton Square while improving his English and absorbing the city�s museums and theatres. Mallarm�s later works�like �Un coup de d�s jamais n�abolira le hasard��experimented with typography, syntax and suggestion, aiming to evoke rather than describe. His Paris salon became a gathering place for painters and writers including Manet and Degas. The London stay marked by this plaque is a brief early episode, but it hints at the international exchanges behind fin-de-si�cle art.",

A witty, combative figure, he had earlier been Foreign Secretary, promoting alliances against Napoleon and cautiously supporting independence movements in Latin America. His rise was hampered by aristocratic suspicion of his modest origins and by bitter party feuds. Canning died in office after only a few months as premier. His London house recalls a political life of eloquent speeches, sharp pamphlet wars and fragile coalitions in the decades after the Napoleonic upheavals.",

Dante Gabriel Rossetti, painter and poet, filled his house with exotic objects and animal companions while painting intensely coloured, symbol-laden works and writing lush, melancholy poems. Cheyne Walk became synonymous with aesthetic bohemia: a riverside terrace where formal gardens hid intense creative and emotional turmoil behind closed doors.",

A coal porter and sailor before turning to boxing, he defeated leading opponents such as Jem Belcher and, most famously, the African-American fighter Tom Molineaux in heavily publicised contests in 1810 and 1811. These bouts attracted huge crowds and political overtones. After retiring undefeated, Cribb became a publican in London, running the Union Arms (later known as the Tom Cribb) and remaining a celebrated sporting figure. His career symbolises early 19th-century pugilism, before the adoption of the Queensberry Rules and gloved boxing.",

Ulysses (1922) follows one day in Dublin through interior monologue and shifting styles; Finnegans Wake pushes language itself to breaking point. Joyce spent most of his adult life in continental exile�Trieste, Zurich, Paris�but dealt constantly with London publishers, lawyers and allies during censorship battles over Ulysses. London visits, negotiations and literary networks were crucial to getting his work into English print.",

His major commissions include Blenheim Palace, Chatsworth and Stowe. Brown worked closely with architects and estate owners, often redesigning entire parks and approaches. From London offices and contacts he managed a huge practice, and his style became so influential that much of the English countryside still bears his imprint.",

Living for many years at Box Hill in Surrey, Meredith influenced writers including Thomas Hardy and Virginia Woolf. His dense, aphoristic style and strong, complex female characters made him a bridge between Victorian fiction and literary modernism.",

Often reporting from front lines, she wrote vivid dispatches about civilians caught in war, refusing to treat conflict as abstract strategy. She covered the Normandy landings by stowing away on a hospital ship and later reported on the liberation of Dachau. Also the third wife of Ernest Hemingway, she fiercely resisted being defined by that relationship. London was one of her bases between assignments.",

She translated Perrault�s fairy tales, taught creative writing and wrote journalism on film, politics and culture. Based largely in London in later years, she became a major influence on contemporary fiction.",

Only documents and this plaque attest to its existence. The street name later lent itself to modern landmarks like the Gherkin at 30 St Mary Axe, so the marker quietly connects today�s glass towers back to a lost parish church and its small congregation.",
