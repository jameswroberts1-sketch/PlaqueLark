The Second World War (1939-1945) resulted in Ford returning to Trafford Park to produce the Rolls Royce Merlin aero-engine under licence which was used in the Spitfire and the Lancaster.  The new factory on Barton Dock Road was located close to the original Ford site and on completion the factory buildings spanned over 44 acres.  By June 1941 the company was producing 400 engines a month; by 1943 the figure had risen to 900.  The Merlin engine was described by the Royal Air Force as a \"Wizard' engine.",

New foundations were laid for the roads and buildings of this fort. Fort III c AD 160 - c AD 200. The third fort extended to the west in order to house a mixed garrison of infantry and cavalry. Before this new fort was built the remains of the older fort (II) were removed and much of the soft ground where ditches lay was dug out and filled with firmer foundations. A rampart made of turf was built and this was capped by a timber palisage. Fort II c ad 90-c AD 160. The earlier fort (I) was replaced by a more substantial one that lay in the same position. It had two lines of defensive ditches which can be seen in the section. Fort I c AD 79 - c AD 90. The first fort was of timber and designed to hold a garrison of around 480 foot soldiers. The timber rampart or wall of this fort lay to the east. Outside of the wall was a series of defensive ditches which can be seen in the section. Beyond these lay a service road.",

Boatbuilding has been part of the life of the River irwell from the earliest times, and the river has always been navigated for trade. In 1828 the biggest boat yet to be built on the Irwell was launched into the river, she was named the Emma, after the builder's daughter. On the day, great crowds assembled on the banks of the Irwell, bands played and the lord Mayors of Manchester and Salford attended the ceremony with a huge entourage. it was a carnival atmosphere with children playing and vendors clamouring for business. When the ship was launched a huge cheer went up, but the triumphant moment soon turned to disaster. The boat powered across the river and smashed into the opposite bank. The dignitaries were thrown into the water, amongst them women and children and guests of the lord Mayors of the two cities. The Emma rolled over and capsized. Onlookers dashed down the banks to help but were soon adding to the terror of the moment. 22 people died that day, including the daughter of the Lord Mayor of Salford. one man, a Scot who lived and worked locally had come down to watch, an accomplished swimmer, he quickly undressed and dived into the water again and again to save lives. Eventually bedraggled and exhausted, he returned to shore only to find his clothes had been stolen. he died the same day from hypothermia.",

His compositions combined elements of his beloved Polish culture  with universal ones , which gave his music wide international appeal.    He visited Manchester in the year before his death at the early age of 39.  On Monday, August 28th, 1848, a gravely ill Fryderyk Chopin gave  a Gala Concert before a rapturous audience of 1200  at the Gentlemen’s Concert Hall, which was situated at the corner of  Peter Street and Lower Moseley Street.    Despite serious Ill-health he insisted that he would perform, a fact which has forever  endeared him to Mancunians and music lovers everywhere.",

We are certain that such a glorious consultation will cement great Britain and the united states in close and enduring regards this statue is the work of sculptor George Grey Barnard and was presented to the city of Manchester by Mr & Mrs Phelps Taft of Cincinnati, Ohio. it commemorates the support that the working people of Manchester gave in their fight for the abolition of slavery during the American civil war by supporting the union under president Lincoln at a time when there was an economic blockade of the southern states, the Lancashire cotton workers were denied access to raw cotton which caused considerable unemployment throughout the cotton industry.      Abraham Lincoln  born 12th February 1809 - assassinated 15th April 1865  President of the USA 1861 - 1865  American civil war 15th April 1861 - 9th April 1865  To the working people of Manchester 19th January 1863 I know and deeply deplore the sufferings which the working people of Manchester and in all Europe are called to endure in this crisis. it has been often and studiously represented that the attempt to overthrow this government, which was built on the foundation of human rights, and to substitute for it one which should rest exclusively on the basis of slavery, was likely to obtain the favour of Europe. through the action of disloyal citizens. the working people of Europe have been subjected to a severe trial for the purpose of forcing their sanction to that attempt. Under these circumstances I cannot but regard your decisive utterances upon the question as an instance of sublime christian heroism which has not been surpassed in any age or in any country. It is indeed an energetic and re-inspiring assurance of the inherent truth and of the ultimate and universal triumph of justice, humanity and freedom. I hail this interchange of sentiments therefore, as an augury that whatever else may happen, whatever misfortune may befall your country or my own, the peace and friendship which now exists between the two nations will be as it shall be my desire to make them, perpetual",

   "inscription": "The Old Wellington existed in 1552, when Edward VI was on the throne, in what was then the Market Place and Shambles. It is now the oldest building in Manchester. In 1554 it was purchased by the Byrom family and was part residence and part drapers shop. The third storey was added in the mid 17th Century. In 1691 John Byrom who developed phonetic shorthand was born here. The building was licensed in 1830 and known as \"The Vintners Arms\" and later as \"Kenyons Vaults\". By 1865 the ground floor was known as \"The Wellington Inn\" whilst the upper floors served as \"Mathematical and Optical Instrument Makers\". The familiar large lantern already existed on the corner of the building, In 1897 the upper two storeys became \"Ye Olde Fyshing Tackle Shoppe\" and a large clock was added to the main gable. In 1974 a concrete raft was cast under the building and the whole structure raised 1.5 metres as part of the Arndale Centre development. A terrorist bomb caused considerable damage to The Old Wellington and the Arndale Centre in 1996. After restoration completed in 1997, the city centre rebuilding plan involved moving The Old Wellington some 300 metres towards the Cathedral. Over a period of more than two years the building was dismantled timber by timber and re-erected here in its new home, where it reopened in November 1999.",

   "inscription": "Murrays' Mills Murrays' Mills are amongst the world's earliest steam-powered cotton spinning factories. They were constructed for Adam and George Murray, Scottish machine makers and cotton spinners, between 1797 and 1804 and employed over 1200 people. Visitors from Europe and North America came to Manchester, the first city of the Industrial Revolution, to marvel at its technology, its buildings and its new way of life. The original complex consisted of six buildings grouped around an open quadrangle. The extended Old Mill forms the south side and New Mill the north side, each with a detached engine house. Warehousing and offices occupied the Murray Street block to the west, its great gate providing the only entrance and exit for pedestrians and wagons. The central canal basin linked to the Rochdale Canal by a tunnel, provided access for barges carrying coal, raw cotton and finished thread. the lost Bengal Street block completed the square to the east. Cotton spinning continued at the mills for 150 years. The second half of the 20th century saw their decline and decay. Murrays' Mills were known to be of national historic significance. In 1998 Ancoats Buildings Preservation Trust initiated their rescue. Supported by the National Lottery through the Heritage Lottery Fund, the Northwest Regional Development Agency and Manchester City Council, the Trust led a programme of permanent repair which was completed in July 2006.",

The purpose of the Nico Ditch is unclear; it may have been used as a defensive fortification or as an administrative boundary.  Regardless of its earlier use, the ditch has been used as a boundary since at least the Medieval Period  One legend has it that the Nico Ditch was completed in a single night by the inhabitants of Manchester as a protection against Viking invaders 869-870.  Each man had a set area of the ditch to construct and was required to dig the ditch and build a bank equal to his own height",
